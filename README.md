# MapScore

MapScore runs a portal for scoring probability maps for lost-person behavior, using
actual cases from the International Search & Rescue Incident Database (ISRID). See
[this post](http://sarbayes.org/projects/mapscore/mapscore-a-portal-for-scoring-probability-maps/)
for more details. Or [search sarbayes.org](http://sarbayes.org/?s=mapscore) for posts,
papers, and talks.

MapScore was funded by an NSF REU grant to George Mason & Brigham Young Universities, and used 
to be hosted at http://mapscore.sarbayes.org, run from a desktop server at the George Mason University 
C4I Center. It was eventually suspended due to not much use. 

This GitHub site includes a subset of the ~400 ISRID cases that were used for MapScore. [ISRID 
is available](https://www.dbs-sar.com/SAR_Research/ISRID.htm) from Dr. Bob Koester at dbS-SAR. 
The Arizona, New York, and Yosemite cases included here are free for distribution.

An ArcGIS-based [ISRID data collection](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/GeoForm/index.html?appid=f85d239f057a4d7399047e862b96ff48&webmap=f5af92358f944815bd983407f56fe5b6)
form is also available online.
