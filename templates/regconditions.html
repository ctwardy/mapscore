                This website is only for testing and ranking models of lost
                person behavior.  A good score does not necessarily mean that
                model will work well in an actual search.  Actual searches
                should be run by trained incident commanders.  Models should be
                selected carefully, with attention to what variables they
                include and omit, and tempered with local and case-specific
                expertise.
