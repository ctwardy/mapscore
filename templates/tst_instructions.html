<b> 	<i><b> The following set of procedures will allow you to successfully conduct a  <br>
	test of your model. Please follow these procedures precisely in order  <br>
	to allow our system to accurately rate your model.<b></i> <br><br>
	
	A) For each test, you will be given 4 (lat,lon) points governing the boundary<br>
	of the search region. You will use these points in addition to the provided  <br>
	information regarding number of horizontal and vertical cells to construct a  <br>
	grid of square cells for your search region. Each cell must have the same height  <br>
	and width. In order to verify that this vital step had been performed correctly,  <br>
	for each test you must first pass an assessment where we provide you with 9 (lat,lon) <br>
	coordinates and you return the corresponding grid cell of those coordinates. This will  <br>
	ensure that both our and your interpretation of the test results are consistent. Grid  <br>
	cells are identified in the following manner:  <br><br><br></b>
	
	<div style = 'padding-left:100px'> <img src = "/media/grid_example.png" width ='271' height = '270'> </div>
	<br> <br><br>
	
	B) Your model will then rate each respective grid cell based on probability that  <br>
	the lost person will be located in that cell. This process is left to you and your <br>
	individual model. You are encouraged to use all provided test case information as  <br>
	well as all layers needed as input to your model  <br><br>
	
	C) Once you have run your model and have developed a rating for each cell, you must  <br>
	then construct a grayscale image representing your result. Each pixel in your  <br>
	grayscale image will represent a cell in your rated grid. For example, if your  <br>
	grid has 'H' horizontal cells and 'V' vertical cells, you will return a grayscale  <br>
	image with exactly 'H x V' pixels. In your grayscale image, the lighter the pixel<br>
	shade, the higher the probability that an individual is found in the corresponding <br>
	grid cell. Thus, a shade of black represents low probability where a shade of white  <br>
	represents high probability. We request that the grayscale image submitted is in (.png) <br>
	format with color bands labeled as either 'P' or 'L'<br><br>
	
	D) Lastly, you will be prompted to submit your grayscale image for analysis  <br>
	Once submitted, we will rate your image and close out the test case. You will  <br>
	now only be able to view the case and can make no more modifications. The new <br>
	rating will be added to your model's overall rating and your leaderboard status  <br>
	will be updated.  <br><br>
