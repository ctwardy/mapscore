                On your account menu, there is a link to edit your account.
                When you go to that page, your will be prompted with an account form
                with your current information filled in. Do not edit the fields that you wish
                to keep. Your current account photo will be kept even if you don't upload
                anything. To delete your current account photo, check off the box underneath
                the upload button. If you want to use a new account photo, 
                upload a new photo to replace your current account photo.
                When you are finished updating your profile, enter your old password at the
                bottom of the form to verify all changes. You can also choose to delete an 
                individual model or delete your entire account at any time.
